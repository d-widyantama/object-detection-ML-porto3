# Object Detection Project using Pre-Trained Deep Learning Model
## Tags: OpenCV, TensorFlow, Python

In this venture, we harnessed the power of the EfficientDet-Lite2 Object Detection model from the Tensorflow Hub library. Trained meticulously on the COCO17 dataset, encompassing 91 different labels, this model was optimized for TFLite applications. What it delivers is remarkable:
The box boundaries of detection
The detection scores (probabilities of a given class)
The detection classes
The number of detections

Our tools were not just limited to code; we employed VideoCapture from OpenCV to breathe life into our project, capturing video directly from the computer webcam.
